# C# / Dotnet

## Common

### String vs string builder
The string is an immutable type in C#, which means it can’t be changed once it’s been created. StringBuilder, on the other hand, is mutable, which means that if an operation is performed on the string object, it won’t construct a new instance in memory every time, unlike string.

### [Access Modifiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers)
- *public*: The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it. The accessibility level of public members of a type is controlled by the accessibility level of the type itself.
- *private*: The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.
- *protected*: The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class.
- *internal*: The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly. In other words, internal types or members can be accessed from code that is part of the same compilation.
- *protected internal*: The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it's declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly.
- *private protected*: The type or member can be accessed by types derived from the class that are declared within its containing assembly.

### Override vs overload

Overloading is the ability to have multiple methods within the same class with the same name, but with different parameters.

public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
    public int Add(int a, int b, int c) => a + b +c;
    public double Add(double a, double b) => a + b;
    public double Add(double a, double b, double c) => a + b + c;
} 

Overriding, on the other hand, is the ability to redefine the implementation of a method in a class that inherits from a parent class.

### [Generics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/generics)

Generic means the general form, not specific. In C#, generic means not specific to a particular data type.

C# allows you to define generic classes, interfaces, abstract classes, fields, methods, static methods, properties, events, delegates, and operators using the type parameter and without the specific data type. A type parameter is a placeholder for a particular type specified when creating an instance of the generic type.

A generic type is declared by specifying a type parameter in an angle brackets after a type name, e.g. TypeName<T> where T is a type parameter.

### [Delegates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates)

C# delegates are similar to pointers to functions, in C or C++. A delegate is a reference type variable that holds the reference to a method. The reference can be changed at runtime.

Delegates are especially used for implementing events and the call-back methods. All delegates are implicitly derived from the System.Delegate class.

### Diff between a.equals(b) and a == b
